  title: Lookup Table of Sales Reporting Entities
  summary: | # Short version of the description to appear in data explorer list
    A lookup table to cross reference reporters of electricity sales for EIA and PCE data sources.
  description: | # Description of what this dataset is and what it is doing here
    This lookup table cross references entities that report electricity sales to sources of electricity generation data: the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) and the State of Alaska's Power Cost Equalization (PCE) program. Sales information from PCE is generally community based; this is different from sales information from EIA, which is utility based. This is further complicated by the fact that several utilities (AVEC, AP&T, IPEC, and MKEC) own operations in multiple communities. A sales reporter unique identifier was created to combine data from these two sources and associate it with electrical grids. This table was manually created and extended with publicly available information.

        First pulled data from the original sources, and compiled, corrected, harmonized, transformed it into Excel Workbooks as annual datasets 2011-2021. This process required a collection of lookup tables for elements such as power plants, power plant operators, sales reporting entities, and grids. These lookup tables were updated in the spring of 2025.

        1. Contracted Neil McMahon to produce the 2011-2021 Workbooks, and then posted them in GitHub for distribution.
        2. Contracted Neil McMahon in the spring of 2025 to update the lookup tables so that future production of the Alaska Energy Statistics Tables could be performed internally at ACEP.
        3. Translated tabs in the Excel workbook of lookup tables into CSV files. There are some problems with the variable types of codes because of the treatment of missing values by the Python script that did the extraction.
