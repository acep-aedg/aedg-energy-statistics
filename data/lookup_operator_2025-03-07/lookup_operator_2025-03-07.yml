  title: Lookup Table of Operators
  summary: | # Short version of the description to appear in data explorer list
    A lookup table to cross reference operators of electrical power plants.
  description: | # Description of what this dataset is and what it is doing here
    This lookup table cross references IDs between common sources of generation data: operator IDs from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) and utility IDs from the State of Alaska's Power Cost Equalization (PCE) program. All sorts of entities operate power plants. EAch might be an electric utility, Independent Power Producer (IPPs), military base, industry such as a mine or a fish processing plant, or a state agency. Some report to the EIA, others to the PCE program, others to both, and other to neither. Operators that report for the PCE may have a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN) from the Regulatory Commission of Alaska (RCA), but some operators may only report to the EIA and not have a CPCN. This new identifier provides a single frame of reference for all these cases.

        First pulled data from the original sources, and compiled, corrected, harmonized, transformed it into Excel Workbooks as annual datasets 2011-2021. This process required a collection of lookup tables for elements such as power plants, power plant operators, sales reporting entities, and grids. These lookup tables were updated in the spring of 2025.

        1. Contracted Neil McMahon to produce the 2011-2021 Workbooks, and then posted them in GitHub for distribution.
        2. Contracted Neil McMahon in the spring of 2025 to update the lookup tables so that future production of the Alaska Energy Statistics Tables could be performed internally at ACEP.
        3. Translated tabs in the Excel workbook of lookup tables into CSV files. There are some problems with the variable types of codes because of the treatment of missing values by the Python script that did the extraction.
