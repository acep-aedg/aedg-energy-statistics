The best data is for 100 communities that have been directly surveyed by the Alaska Division of Community and Regional Affairs (DCRA) since 2005. To cover communities not surveyed, DCRA computes regional averages over their economic regions, which AEDG associates with every community within that region. DCRA's survey intentionally omits the urban area of Anchorage because that area is separately surveyed by the Consumer Price Index of the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). These three sources are combined into this summary dataset.\n",

When the survey was established, the national AAA fuel survey only reported Anchorage and Mat-Su pricing so these areas were deliberately excluded from the 100 select communities. The communities have remained constant since the project\u2019s inception. The prices for heating fuel in these 100 communities are collected via a telephone survey of each fuel retailer. Survey methodology has evolved over time; however, the reported prices should be considered representative of what a community resident would have paid for a gallon of heating fuel (including tax) on the day of contact.\nAEDG uses this dataset to provide the best heating fuel prices available for the selected communities, and relies on other data sets to fill in communities that are not included in the survey.\n",
