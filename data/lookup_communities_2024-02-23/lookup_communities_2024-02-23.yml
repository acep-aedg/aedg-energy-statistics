  title: Lookup Table of Communities
  summary: | # Short version of the description to appear in data explorer list
    A lookup table to cross references all the identifiers of communities.
  description: | # Description of what this dataset is and what it is doing here
    This lookup table cross references ID of communities from various sources. In the Energy Statistics Workbooks, community name is the primary identifier but string matching can be cumbersome, so geographic positions, census codes, PCE reporting IDs, and GNIS identifiers are also included. For context, there is also Alaska Energy Authority (AEA) Energy Regions and Alaska Native Regional Corporations. Note: This table was not used as the basis for the set of communities used in the Alaska Energy Data Gateway v3.0 (AEDG).

        First pulled data from the original sources, and compiled, corrected, harmonized, transformed it into Excel Workbooks as annual datasets 2011-2021. This process required a collection of lookup tables for elements such as power plants, power plant operators, sales reporting entities, and grids. These lookup tables were updated in the spring of 2025.

        1. Contracted Neil McMahon to produce the 2011-2021 Workbooks, and then posted them in GitHub for distribution.
        2. Contracted Neil McMahon in the spring of 2025 to update the lookup tables so that future production of the Alaska Energy Statistics Tables could be performed internally at ACEP.
        3. Translated tabs in the Excel workbook of lookup tables into CSV files. There are some problems with the variable types of codes because of the treatment of missing values by the Python script that did the extraction.
